`Changelog <https://github.com/jgehrcke/gipc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_ |
`gipc @ PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gipc>`_ |
`gipc @ GitHub <https://github.com/jgehrcke/gipc>`_

Overview
========
gipc enables reliable child process management
and non-blocking inter-process communication in software that uses `gevent
<https://github.com/gevent/gevent>`_.

Using Python's `multiprocessing package
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html>`_ in the context of a
codebase that also uses gevent is error-prone and may break the application in
various `subtle ways
<https://gehrcke.de/gipc/#what-are-the-challenges-and-what-is-gipc-s-solution>`_.
With gipc, ``multiprocessing.Process``-based child processes can again safely be
created in your gevent-powered application. The API of
``multiprocessing.Process`` objects is provided in a gevent-cooperative way.
Also, gipc provides a pipe-based transport layer for gevent-cooperative
inter-greenlet and inter-process communication. gipc is lightweight and easy to
integrate.

From 2012 to 2018, gipc's home was at `bitbucket.org/jgehrcke/gipc
<https://bitbucket.org/jgehrcke/gipc>`_. Since then development has continued on
GitHub.

Code examples
=============

Individual example programs can be found in the `examples
<https://github.com/jgehrcke/gipc/blob/master/examples>`_ directory.



Documentation
=============
Visit https://gehrcke.de/gipc for installation instructions, API docs, code
examples, and in-depth information.


Platform support
================

The current version of gipc works on CPython 3.9 through 3.13. It supports
gevent versions 1.5 and newer and supports both, Unix-like systems as well as
Windows. On Linux and macOS, gipc also works with PyPy.

gipc's continuous integration (CI) pipeline automatically executes a wide range
of tests on Linux, Darwin (macOS), and Windows.
