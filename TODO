A rather randomly ordered set of notes.

- Implement poll/peek on read end. (It's impossible to identify complete
  messages in advance, but within the framework only complete messages
  are sent.)
- Can gevent's FileObjectPosix be of any use?
- Review buffer-implementation, consider, buffer() and memoryview().
- hub.cancel_wait() (cf. gevent sockets) in close instead of lock check?
- Work on portability between Python 2 and 3.
- put() timeout? Relevant in case of pipe being full. However, put()
  duration cannot be controlled if write is blocking *after* partial
  msg write. Doesn't make sense I think.
- Implementation on Windows based on NamedPipes with overlapping IO
  could give useful control. Use libuv as backend instead of libev?
