"""
.. todo::

    - Implement poll/peek on read end. (It's impossible to identify complete
        messages in advance, but within the framework only complete messages
        are sent.)
    - Can gevent's FileObjectPosix be of any use?
    - Review buffer-implementation, consider, buffer(), memoryview(), ..
    - hub.cancel_wait() (cf. gevent sockets) in close instead of lock check?
    - Ensure portability between Python 2 and 3
    - put() timeout? Relevant in case of filled up pipes. However, put()
        duration cannot be controlled if write is blocking *after* partial
        msg write. Doesn't make sense I think.

    - pipe implementation on Windows based on NamedPipes with overlapping IO
        could give useful control:
        - async IO, peeknamedpipe, ReadfileEx, SetCommTimeouts, CancelIO
        - use pywin32 or http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html
        - problem: circumvent blocking Win32 calls (hand control to gevent)
        - async IO without blocking any thread: IOCP

    recommended to create child processes via :func:`start_process`. It takes
    care of

        - re-initialization of the event loop in the child process.

    Calling this method breaks ``os.waitpid()`` on Unix: spawning the first
    child activates libev child watchers, leading to libev reap children in the
    moment they die. Applied to such a child, ``os.waitpid()`` throws
    ``ECHILD`` (cf. http://linux.die.net/man/2/waitid).

    #This leads to multiprocessing's `_popen.wait()` returning `None`, meaning
