What is gipc?
=============
Naive usage of Python's multiprocessing package in the context of a
gevent-powered application may raise various problems and most likely breaks the
application in many ways.

gipc (pronunciation “gipsy”) is developed with the motivation to solve these
issues transparently and make using gevent in combination with
multiprocessing-based child processes and inter-process communication (IPC) a
no-brainer again. With gipc, multiprocessing.Process-based child processes can
safely be created anywhere within your gevent-powered application. Furthermore,
gipc provides gevent-cooperative inter-process communication and useful helper
constructs. gipc is lightweight and very simple to integrate.


What are the boundary conditions?
=================================
Currently, gipc is tested on CPython 2.6 & 2.7 and developed against gevent
1.0rc2.


Where is the documentation?
===========================
The API documentation and further details can be found at
http://gehrcke.de/gipc.


Is gipc stable?
===============
Development began in late 2012. gipc is not mature. However, as of version
0.3.0, I am not aware of any fundamental issue. Via extensive unit testing, gipc
has been validated to work reliable in scenarios of low and medium complexity.
It is ready to be evaluated in the context of serious projects. Please let me
know how it performs for you.


From where can I retrieve official releases?
=============================================
Releases are available at `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gipc>`_.
The development version can be retrieved from the mercurial repository at
`bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/jgehrcke/gipc>`_.


How can the unit tests be run?
==============================
If you run into troubles with gipc, it is a good idea to run the unit test suite
under your conditions. The unit tests are written for
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`_. With `gipc/test` (included in the release) as the
current working directory, I usually run tests like this::

    $ py.test -v -x
